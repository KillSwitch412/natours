# natours âœˆ

This is my implementation of the final 'natours' course project from the udemy course [Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/).

## introduction

Natours is a tourism website where the users can sign up and book for tours, users can also create and rate other tours.

Natours frontend is made with HTML and CSS, and backnend with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB.

The Project has it's own API which is used as a server as well as an api for general use.
